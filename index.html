<h1>My Baseball Dice Game</h1>

<main>
<p>This is a simple little baseball dice game I came up with a while ago when I was bored. At the time, I did make a few different versions, but this is by far the best one. It uses two six-sided dice and a special result list to simulate batting outcomes. The way the game works is that players roll the dice and use their sum to reference the result list.</p>
<h2>The Result List</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 - Ground Out</li>
<li>3 - Triple</li>
<li>4 - Single (Double if 2/2 is rolled)</li>
<li>5 - Fly Out</li>
<li>6 - Strike Out</li>
<li>7 - Pop Out</li>
<li>8 - Strike Out</li>
<li>9 - Fly Out</li>
<li>10 - Single (Double if 5/5 is rolled)</li>
<li>11 - Home Run</li>
<li>12 - Ground Out</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this game uses a highly simplified version of the standard baseball rules, only things such as base runner positions, outs, scored runs, and innings must be kept track of by the player. Things such as strikes, balls, errors, and other stuff are completely ignored. Below are some statistics, which were calculated from the aforementioned result list.</p>
<h3>In Game Statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hits - 6</li>
<li>Outs - 15</li>
<li>At-Bats - 21</li>
<li>Batting Average - .286</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this game quite a lot because the rules are easy to remember and it is very fun to play.</p>
